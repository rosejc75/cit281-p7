## Welcome to Rose's Project 7!

This project included using GitHub to create a portfolio

### Creating Repos
The first thing I did was create a new repository. From there I made a user entry web page and created repos for all my labs and projects. After this I went into the terminal and cloned all my lab and project files into a "website" folder to put into GitHub. after this I wrote descriptions on every lab and project and what i learned from them.
